Croatian Educational and Development Network for the Evolution of Understanding (HERMES) is a non-governmental non-profit organization with headquarters in Zagreb. The organization was founded in order to promote critical thinking and to develop creative thinking in the context of social action and development of (self)expressing as an instrument of empowering all members of society, particularly marginalized social groups through verbal and nonverbal communication. The goal is to break well-established patterns of thinking through active listening and creative/non-standard thinking and acting. The purpose is to improve and create the quality of dialogue as one of the ways of prevention and solving problems, conflicts and misunderstanding.
