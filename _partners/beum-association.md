BEUM Association is one of the oldest BETA Europe partners, starting the first Belgrade Model European Union way back in 2017. BEUM Association also hosted the second MEU Symposium in Belgrade. Apart from MEU-related activities, BEUM Association has been very active on the Serbian startup scene with two major projects - Smart City Challenge Serbia and Garage Lab Belgrade, with the focus on new technologies such as Internet of Things, Augmented reality and Blockchain.
