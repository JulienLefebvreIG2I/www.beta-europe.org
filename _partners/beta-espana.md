Model European Union Granada is a simulation of the ordinary legislative
procedure of the European Union. MEUG mainly aims to provide university
students with a thorough knowledge of the decision-making process (ordinary
legislative procedure) which is carried out in the EU headquarters. It
vividly represents the way new EU legislation comes to force. The European
Commission, played by the organising team, drafts and initiates the new
legislation while the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, played
by the participants, decide to amend it, adopt it or reject it. This way,
participants are assigned roles either as Members of the European
Parliament or as Ministers of the Council. In order to facilitate
communication between both institutions and to provide the project with a
touch of reality, participants will also play the role of journalists and
interpreters.

It is being organised by BETA España, a non-profit national youth
association founded in the summer of 2011 and whose primary goal is to
bring young people closer to how EU institutions work.

We believe that this project will not only give students a more in-depth
knowledge about how the EU legislative procedure works but it will also
give them the chance to live it first hand!
