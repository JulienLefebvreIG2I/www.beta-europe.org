The **MEU Symposium 2016** will take place May 12th to 15th in Belgrade, Serbia. The
Symposium will bring together representatives of the numerous Model European
Union conferences currently being organized across Europe, as well as participants
interested in setting up an MEU conference of their own. We will discuss the
concept of MEU conferences as well as their organizing process to share best
practices, train interested parties to become expert organizers, and to further
develop our network of MEU conferences.

We thank the BEUM student organization for being our partner in organizing this event!
