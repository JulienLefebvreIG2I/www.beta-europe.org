The MEU Symposium is a forum for organisers of MEU conferences and those who wish to organise one to meet and share their experience and best practices. The Symposium serves as a useful training event for MEU organisers as well as an annual convention of MEU organisers from all associations within the MEU network.

#### Key Facts

* Event coordinator: Bringing Europeans Together Association e.V.
* Local partner: BEUM Student Association
* Length of the event: 4 days (Thursday to Sunday)
* Date and location: May 12th to 15th in Belgrade, Serbia
* Number of attendees: 50

#### Purpose of the event

The MEU Symposium will bring together representatives of the numerous Model 
European Union conferences currently being organised across Europe, as well as 
participants interested in setting up an MEU conference of their own. The 
Symposium will thus serve two purposes:

For **experienced MEU organisers** the goal is to discuss the development of the 
MEU network in order to ensure qualitative and structural coherence and 
consistency between MEU conferences, to jointly develop the “brand” MEU and to 
share best practices and experiences between one another.

For those **new to the organisation of an MEU** wishing to join an organizing 
team or to set up an MEU conference of their own the purpose is to learn about 
the fundamental aspects and principles of MEU conferences, organisational and 
legal first steps of founding an association, team recruitment, team management 
and volunteer leadership, successful public relations and fundraising work and 
how to contribute to the political education of young Europeans through hosting 
simulations of the European institutions.
