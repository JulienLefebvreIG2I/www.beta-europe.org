On 13 September the [Lifelong Learning Platform](http://lllplatform.eu) together with the [European Youth Forum](http://youthforum.org) and [Eurodesk ](http://eurodesk.eu)launched a new campaign calling for a 10 times increase to the budget of the Erasmus+ programme. The #Erasmusx10 campaign is based on the rationale "10 reasons why 10 times more", which include the need to widen participation among under-represented groups, promote active citizenship and support reforms of national education systems. A 10x increase would also allow more individuals to benefit from a mobility experience, therefore improving their life prospects with higher employability chances and stronger political participation.
