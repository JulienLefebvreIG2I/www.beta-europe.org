The Model European Union (MEU) Symposium is a successful new event aimed at providing a forum for BETA's partners to come together and share experience and best practices in organising MEU conferences. It is also a great opportunity for younger partners to attend useful workshops on what makes a great MEU conference.The past editions of  the MEU Symposium were held in Berlin, Germany as well as Split, Croatia, Belgrade, Serbia, thanks to the cooperation with HERMES and BEUM teams.


The Symposium has received in the past E+ funding and it is planned to apply again for E+ funding for the MEU Symposium 2018 in the October round.

As each year we're looking for a local partner who wants to host the project in their city. It will be done in close cooperation with BETA Europe, the local partner takes over the logistics and social program of the conference.

If you wish to host the MEUSym 2018, please [apply here](https://forum.beta-europe.org/new-message?groupname=BETA-CP&title=Call+for+MEU+Symposium+2018+Host&body=%0D%0A%0D%0A%2APlease+conclude+your+message+with+answers+to+the+following+questions%21%2A%0D%0A%0D%0AName+of+your+association%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AName+and+function+of+the+representative%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AEmail+address%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AProposed+city+to+host+the+MEU+Symposium+2018%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AHas+a+member+of+your+association+attended+any+edition+of+the+MEU+Symposium+2015-2017%3F%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASince+when+has+your+association+been+organising+their+MEU+conference%3F%0D%0A%0D%0AHow+much+manpower+can+you+afford+for+the+MEU+Symposium+in+the+Summer+of+2018%3F+Are+the+people+from+your+MEU+team%3F%0D%0A%0D%0AUsually+the+Symposium+is+planned+for+July+-+is+it+a+suitable+date+for+you%3F+If+not%2C+which+month%3F%0D%0A%0D%0ADo+you+have+proposals+or+ideas+for+the+accommodation+during+the+event%3F+If+possible%2C+include+an+estimation+of+costs.+%2840-50+participants%29%3A%0D%0A%0D%0ADo+you+have+access+to+university+rooms+or+other+venues+free+of+charge+for+NGOs%3F+If+not%2C+what+venues+would+you+recommend%3F%0D%0A%0D%0ACan+you+give+us+a+rough+estimate+on+the+total+cost+of+the+event%2C+counting+for+50+people%3F+%28please%2C+remember%2C+in+the+E%2B+framework+staff+is+not+paid%29%0D%0A%0D%0AAnd+lastly%3A+what+makes+your+city+unique%3F%0D%0A) to reach out to the BETA Europe Concepts and Partnerships [team](https://forum.beta-europe.org/groups/BETA-CP).
