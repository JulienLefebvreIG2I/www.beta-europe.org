Model European Union Mainz (MEUM) provides a unique simulation of EU decision-making and politics and takes place annually in Mainz. Located at the river Rhine, the city is not only famous for Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of book print, but also for its old market place and its vibrant student life with one of Germanyâ€™s biggest universities only 10 minutes from the city centre. Each year, the conference brings together students from all over the world, giving them the opportunity to experience the functioning of European institutions themselves.
