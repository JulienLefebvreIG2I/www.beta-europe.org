The **MEU Symposium** is a forum for organisers of MEU conferences and those who wish to organise one to meet and share their experience and best practices. The Symposium serves as a useful training event for MEU organisers as well as an annual convention of MEU organisers from all associations within the MEU network.

The participants will be accommodated in the *Modern Hostel Belgrade*, which is less than 200m away from the main square (Republic Square). It is a new and very nicely furnished hostel. The breakfast will be organised in the cafe-restaurant below. The hostel has free WiFi.

The sessions will be held at the *Faculty of Diplomacy and Security*, one of the most prominent institutions for education in international relations and international security. It is situated in the charming hip district of Savamala, close to the very bustling cultural scene.
